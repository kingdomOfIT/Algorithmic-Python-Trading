## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

This project is a Python-based algorithmic trading tool leveraging the Jupyter environment. Using data from the S&P 500 stocks and the IEX Cloud API, it assists in making investment decisions by providing insights into stock prices, market capitalization, and suggesting the number of shares to buy based on a user-defined portfolio size. The tool generates a comprehensive report in an Excel format for easy analysis and decision-making.
